Probably not. I could write some tech-y things but there are so many
blogs out there, and I know first hand that I don't tend to read many
of them. But, the ones that I appreciate are those posts that have
gone the extra mile and given something I really value. And they have
generally been a level deeper than the "beginner" variety.`),

some form of intermediate to advanced information. I think there are a
lot of beginner branded posts out there. I think they are good and
they work. I think I could even write some of them myself and they
might be useful. I'm simply torn, because I would like to help people
get some insights into a whole variety of tech, but I'd also like to
learn along the way.`),

to learn things. It helps me solidify my thinking once I have to put
those ideas, or practices, or insights, or learnings into writing.`),

interesting trying to accomplish that: learning and writing about what
I learn at the same time. I'm hoping that I can maintain a tone of
wonder, and a bit of excitement in trying and learning new
things. While at the same time, I get to learn a few things on topics
I've been eager to understand.`),

something I'm diving into.`),

posts. N-things you should know, or learn, or do. I don't really want
to post those kinds of things. So I want to learn how to be successful
