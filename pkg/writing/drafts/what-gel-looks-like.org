* Generating HTML with Go (not using templates)
  I wrote a library not too long ago that I called =gel= that generates
  HTML from within Go code.  The library doesn't use templates.  I
  wrote it years ago and kind of forgot about it.

  But recently, I've started getting a bit annoyed with Go Templates.
  So I looked to using it on the latest rendition of this site.  I'll
  call it the July 2022 rendition, just to mark the date.  This is the
  3rd or 4th time I've written this site.  And for the record there
  was a Pug version, an org-mode with emacs batch conversion version,
  and I think a react version at some point as well.  This is the Gel
  version.
